In October 2012, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. 
Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia 
	by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. 
A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1.0000 indicates excess readmissions.
